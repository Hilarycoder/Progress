  	    <h2><u>ABOUT ME</u></h2>
  	    <p>MY story starts when I was a young boy about 7yrs old, I saw an indian movie called <b>EITHAN THE ROBOT</b>, and I was obsessed, so I started liking making robots but had got an end due to the poverty that was at the place I was living, I couldn't afford the tools used in robotics, so, I let it go and I gave up, I thought that my journey in robotics had got to its end, Lucky enough I stood back onto my feet and said I must do it and that was in the days of the early <b>COVID19</b> And I saw a Guy on YOUTUBE teaching robotics and said "TO Automate a robot U need coding" and I wondered what was coding,I got confused and started doing some research alon GOOGLE and YOUTUB, there were many languages, I didn't know which language to ASuse but Now  I know som e the best languages in coding like JAVASCRIPT, JAVA,PYTHON, C#</p>
